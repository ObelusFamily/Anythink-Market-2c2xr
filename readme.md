# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app you need to have docker installed. 
You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: `docker -v`.

Run the command: `Docker-compose up` from the project root directory. It'll start both frontend and the backend.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

Go to (http://localhost:3000/api/ping) to verify that backend is running.

To check frontend go to (http://localhost:3001/register) and Create a new user account.
